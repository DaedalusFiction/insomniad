#### Outside the Library

Two children have soaked each other with water guns,
arms lethargic in the heat. There is no bite
to the proceedings. One is clearly much older
than the other.

Someone has set a chair in the middle of the road,
in the little-used appendage
of the traffic circle. I stand in the yogurt aisle
reading all the labels.

I am suspended in the summer’s buoyancy. The only word
is lackadaisical. There is a carving
of a monkey on display.
Her nostrils are flared, perhaps in anger.

This cough has lasted nearly a month. Some things will never
change.
Some things will pursue me into the twilight
of my life.

I have met someone in the portal. The howling
animal inside me
is—briefly—

silenced.

#### Fury

I thought that the motherfuckers
had finally discontinued their catcalling
when actually what happened is that I had purchased nicer headphones
and started wearing them
always
even whilst taking out the trash.

My friend lived in a second floor apartment in Paris and one afternoon
she glanced into her mirror and saw
two hands
reaching into frame,
grasping the wrought iron railing
of her balcony.

Fury:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Salman Rushdie novel, in it women die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on this island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their scalps repurposed as mementos;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a chthonic deity, bestower of pestilence;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two men fighting on the crowded Overground when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are already wearing masks and on our way to Stratford,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no need to make the situation worse, but go on keep spitting and struggling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the press of bodies;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thought of you feeling joy somewhere, when I did not mean yes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to any of it.

#### Moon Poem III (Sonnet)

Tell me, how may I press nearer to (my
own) loveliness? I kidnap the body
of my younger self; it's been vandalized
for another’s pleasure, I wish to see

if I can feel something beyond this ache,
waking up in the late morning, head split,
bestial poison burning through my veins—
I share blood, the deer’s uneasy spirit.

Or else I lived so I could punish (this
self) and as a lightning rod for that rage.
Once, I hid the kitchen knives. Reminisce:
I got so good at ducking, the bouquet

of bruises failed to bloom; the moon and sun
attend to the debris and brawl, unsung.

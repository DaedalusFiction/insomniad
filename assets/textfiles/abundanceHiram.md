Come every blackboard and shoreline
Come dawn walks or weed seeds
Come tips of twigs
And come alleys and neon signs or soup bowls
Come one and all
And come hopes and needs
Come all moonlight or muskets
Come sextants and scriptures
Or arrows and spaceships
Come card tricks and washcloths
And especially bees

And come all corners grinning and barns
Come running or crawling or spinning
Come tragic and joyful
Come lilies or fleas
And graveyards or mud nests
Come windows wide open
And gushes
Come holding tight to moreover
Come tossing the salads with tease
While counting the ways

And most of all please
Come backwards and forwards
Super or duper
Under but over
As ever you can

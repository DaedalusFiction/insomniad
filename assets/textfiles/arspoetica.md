slimy & joy-wet. you're night's work of art, hatched from nothing

into the belly of a jaw—softening the hard ground of language.

your pronouns: ruffled between edges, as the heft threatens

to refund your mother in past perfect tense.
<br/>
my tongue, raised towards your image—spills the purple consonant

where a curve ends. say, I howl into wetness, shards of you

grieve out in thanksgiving. you, scolding bronze into portrait.
<br/>
light waylays me, till I whiten & duplicate. whiten & play dead:

remnant on God's own soil. when I was dirt, you litter me over a countertop.

when I went missing, you cast the net of your palm into

space—molding my worth. at the mention of grief, this poem bear loopholes:

a landslide from where language leaks.
<br/>
I english my tongue. mouth verb by helping-verb, stitch you into a gowned

paraphrase: whatever dresses up to grief. whatever aggrieves dying.

your coral bleached eyes, blooded with light.

the roundness carpet bombs earth's swollen surface, as wreck tiles

the land into a shiver: an offshoot of ray—veining through cosmos.
<br/>
my blood labour over the current. I wear my name in reverse &

go contrary to destiny, contrary to life's broken abecedary.

the hereafter holds me by my initials.

the gap between silence & the voiceless consonant, brightened as a knife.
<br/>
the clock as we know, is a gadget that color us wasteful.

how tedious—the lavish. tongue, groomed to blend dizziness

with a drowsy language, to witness the face soil bedsheets

with multiple resemblance. your cracked curvature, unspooling pigments.
<br/>
say day lingers, you absorb the burden.

say night lingers, you absorb the burden.

say year lurks around, you absorb the bright burden.

& when a decade lingers, the year splits apart

and a boy from my past leaves, unpronounced.

#### NOVEMBER HAZE

Today is a beautiful day
though my sister might be dying
and I still can’t find a job.
All my hands
are on the deck of her body
though I know I have only two.
I must have grown some more
to better grasp these times
when one strong wind
loosens all the leaves.

All I want to do is watch
a boy swing from a tree
dragging a stick
through the yellow grass
as he glides.

The tree does not mind
the weight of him.
The wind does not mind
its unrest.

It is the first Wednesday of the month;
at 1:00 the sirens test their blare
and the black lab sings along
in a howl so alarmed
and so beautifully blue and true
even the birds hush their song.

#### THIS HOUSE THAT HOUSE THIS HOUSE

Before the first <em>this house</em> was a town home, infested with fleas.
We bombed the hell out of that place, to no avail.
I drove a T-Top Firebird and wore feathered earrings,
the year of the Halloween blizzard of ’91.
Thirty-two inches of snow in a day,
the same year my mother passed away.

Before the town home was an upper duplex,
you moved in and that was that.

After the third flea extermination,
we left and
the first <em>this house</em> became our home,
attic filled with bats and all,
a trellis in the garden.

Cats sprawled out like frogs
on the hardwood floor
or smelled of must
from sleeping in the fruit cellar.
They were gargoyles at times
fixing their stares
as though there was something dangerous
floating above them.

The smiles of plate size hibiscus
every August morning
where my mother came to you at night
and whispered <em>take care of her</em>
and for many years you did.

The <em>that house</em> was the country house,
where the ghosts of war still haunt,
explained in ancient poems.
No need to go further here.
I learned to love the moon
and loneliness at its core.

After <em>that house</em> was the second <em>this house</em>
that drowned us in love at first
then nearly ate us both alive.

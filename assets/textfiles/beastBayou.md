When Daddy came home and told us what he’d done, I thought for sure he’d been in his own stash.

The ensuing argument was conducted in whispers. Mama was in bed and we didn’t want to bother her. Daddy set the cuttings down on the table so I could see for myself what he’d sold me for. The <em>Orchidaceae</em> family has thousands of species, forty-four of which are native to Louisiana. While I don’t have every single one of them neatly catalogued in my brain, I couldn’t exactly argue his point—these flowers were unique. Their colors and shapes almost defied description. Collectors will pay thousands of dollars for a rare specimen, and here, Daddy had six. With that kind of money, there could be braces for Lark, doctors for Mama, comfort for Granddaddy in his golden years.

And speaking of Granddaddy, when he heard about the whole business, he hit the roof, but though he cussed and hollered, and the little ones cried, there seemed to be no way around it. If Daddy didn’t hold up his end of the bargain, the whole family would suffer. The orchids Daddy had gathered would wither and die, as would any green and growing thing he touched. Even crabgrass would wilt beneath his feet. How would Daddy support us then?

So, early the next morning, I was shipped off to live with the Beast.

The family gathered on the porch to see me off. I’d expected Daddy to take me in his old pirogue. Instead, a boat appeared out of the morning fog. It was painted blue, with a pattern of vines and flowers around the gunwale. There were no paddles; no one was piloting it. Yet it glided right up to the house and stopped.

Swallowing hard, I got in.

The swamp was my world. I knew every channel and lagoon from Krotz Springs all the way down to Atchafalaya Bay, and I’d never seen hide nor hair of any Beast before. So, I had no earthly idea where this boat might be taking me as it scudded along through the duckweed and salvinia, through stands of cypress and tupelo, their drapings of Spanish moss like a preacher’s vestment, drifting, at last, through a tiny, hidden tributary. I could swear on a stack of Bibles there’d been no such tributary there before, a green tunnel of low-hanging branches with purple clusters of wisteria. Only wisteria doesn’t blossom in January. I don’t know why I was surprised, considering I was riding in a magic boat. The tangles of foliage were so thick, I thought said boat would have to stop and let me out so I could move the branches aside. Instead, the branches moved of their own accord, parting to let the boat pass, then closed again.

The tunnel opened onto another place I’d never seen before—a bayou, a vast, marshy lake wreathed in mist, and through the haze, I glimpsed the turrets of a great house. For a minute there, I thought the place was floating in mid-air, but as I got closer, I saw that it was built on an island. A chateau-style house with balconies, stained-glass windows, and a blue slate roof. A house like a ghost, that improbable and that out of place.

The boat docked itself on the west side of the island. No one was waiting to greet me as I climbed out. I made my way across the silent grounds, to a wide, double staircase. Along its balustrades was a menagerie of stone figures: griffins, gargoyles, sphinxes, temple dogs, all with teeth bared and hackles raised.

When I reached the portico, the front doors clicked open. “Hello?” I called.

No reply.

Cautiously, I went inside. The foyer was just as still and empty as the rest of the place. Overhead, a chandelier winked on and off. Lights along the walls and stairs flickered as well. I got the drift and followed where they led me, up to a spacious bedroom on the second floor. From the balcony, I should’ve been able to see sails and outriggers over the trees, shrimpers and fishing boats headed for the Gulf, but there were none. All I could see for miles in every direction was wetland forest.

I was so preoccupied with taking in the view, I nearly jumped out of my skin when a voice behind me asked, “You’re the one Mr. Saranon sent?” I started to turn my head. “Don’t look at me!”

Hastily, I faced forward again. “I’m Callie Saranon.”

“He was supposed to send a botanist.”

“Well, sir, I been studying the world around me for as far back as I can remember and helping Daddy with his specimens and things.”

“Where’d you go to school?”

“Daddy homeschooled me till I was twelve, then I taught my brother and sisters.”

He snorted. “I should’ve eaten him when I had the chance.”

“Daddy was educated at Tulane, and I’m a real hard worker. Like I said, teaching the little ones, and taking care of ‘em my whole life.”

For a long time, the Beast said nothing, but I could feel his eyes boring into my back.

“If you don’t think I’m up to snuff, you could always dismiss me. No skin off my nose.”

Again, silence.

Just when I thought we were gonna stand here all day, he asked, “Have you been told-- what I am?”

“Yes.”

“And you aren’t frightened?”

“You’re still a person, ain’t ya?”

“See for yourself.”

I turned. A hulking figure stood in the shadows of the bedroom, at least six and a half feet tall, and shaggy as a musk ox. He smelled like one, too, a powerful, overwhelming stink. It reminded me of the time Daddy took it into his head to try making perfume and bought a chunk of ambergris from God knows where. I thought we’d never get that smell out of the lab.

Now, as the Beast stepped more fully into the light, I saw he had the head of a bobcat—

the pointy, tufted ears, the ruffs of fur growing out from his jaw like mutton chops. He wore a suit with a tie and a pocket square. His five-fingered hands were more like bear paws, tipped with three-inch claws. Fearsome, but they didn’t look very dexterous to me. Being a digitrade, his pants were cut short, and he wore no shoes. The claws on his feet appeared to be retractable while the ones on his forepaws were not. His only truly human feature was his eyes. Bobcats have golden eyes, and his were the bright blue of a damselfly.

I looked at him, and he looked right back. I wasn’t no beauty queen myself. I was plain as an old dishrag, and every stitch of clothing I’d ever owned was either a hand-me-down or something homemade with our old treadle sewing machine.

Still eyeing me, he asked, “How old are you, Callie?”

“Seventeen.”

He grunted. As he turned away, I saw that his back had a buffalo hump. “All right. Let’s get to work.”

<hr />

Those first few weeks, I barely slept. I didn’t trust the Beast any more than he trusted me. I stockpiled weapons in my room—a fireplace poker, a pair of gardening shears, a silver candleholder. He never touched me, but all the same, I felt better having them.

I missed my family something awful, even Daddy. I fretted about Mama and Granddaddy’s health, about whether or not everybody was getting enough to eat. Whether Arbor was ready to take over teaching duties for Lark and Zalie. Who would make sure they got their GEDs, went to college?

Once I was over the initial shock and numbness, I tried to run away. The boat wouldn’t go for me, so I had to swim for it. If it hadn’t been almost February and cold, I would’ve been worried about gators, but still, I hauled ass to the opposite bank. I walked and walked, but no matter which way I went, I kept finding myself back at the Beast’s house. At dawn, I gave up and returned to my room, exhausted, muddy, and blue with cold. In my room, a fire and a warm bath awaited me. Flannel nightclothes had been laid out. After I put them on, a cup of hot cocoa appeared.

Well, if there’s one thing I do know, it’s how to make the best of things. I sat down and drank it.

<hr />

The Beast had a greenhouse, a dim room for growing mushrooms and fungus, and a laboratory. At first, all he’d let me do was care for the plants—fertilizing, deadheading, that sort of thing. He had logbooks and charts for me to fill out, keeping track of each plant’s growth and characteristics.

The lab work came gradually—grinding and distilling, concocting teas and tinctures. As I suspected, fine manual work was difficult for him, so I became his hands, examining fragile plant anatomy without damaging anything, prepping slides for the microscope, making detailed drawings. Flipping through the pages I’d filled with my neat handwriting and sketches, the Beast nodded approvingly.

There was fieldwork to be done. The Beast was fanatical about checking the grounds for new growth. Different plants and flowers sprung up without warning, without rhyme or reason—genera and species that weren’t in any of the books. Things no one had ever seen before, like the orchids my father had taken. I remembered the wisteria I’d seen on my way here, blooming at least three months too early.

It was sometime near the end of February when I realized that, though we spent all our time growing things, we had no flowers inside the house itself. So I potted tobacco flowers and lilac, jasmine and gardenias, filling all those large, lonely rooms with perfume. Again, plants that had no business growing in February.

When we weren’t working, I explored the house. It had hot and cold running water and flushing toilets. It had a library, a music room, specimen rooms filled with taxidermy creatures, dried flowers, and mushroom spore prints.

Every morning, a fresh set of clothes appeared for me. A lacquered box on the vanity overflowed with jewelry. How Mama and my sisters would’ve loved to have such pretty things! A silver brush and comb rose into the air and styled my hair for me, sweeping it back in clips or combs. My hands were manicured by floating clippers and cuticle sticks.

There was a kitchen, but all I had to do was say out loud what I wanted, and it would appear on the nearest table. The Beast and I ate dinner together. It was served early, sometimes as early as 4:30. The Beast ate very little, and I never saw him drink from any cups. He seemed more interested in observing me. I was not normally a self-conscious person, but I was keenly aware of his blue gaze, the weight of it like a touch as I brought the fork to my lips.

Then I realized he was going out at dusk. For a creature his size, he moved very stealthily, but his claws still clicked on the marble floors. I’d hear him leave after I retired to my own room. More often than not, I’d fall asleep before he came back, but one night, I managed to stay awake. I peeked out my door to see him vanishing up the steps. He had blood on his clothes, on his mouth.

I waited till the coast was clear, then slipped outside. It was nearly sunrise when I found the deer carcass in the woods, picked clean. I’d just hunkered down to examine the kill when his harsh voice demanded, “Spying on me?”

I shot up and backed away from him.

He advanced, more shadow than form. “You smell like blood.”

I’d grown up in a land of gators, cougars, and yes, bobcats. With every single one of them, the smartest thing you can do is back off. That’s what I was already doing, so I just kept on backing up. I never once looked away from those blazing blue eyes.

He growled, “Do I disgust you?”

“No.”

“Don’t lie to me.”

I shook my head. “I’m not.”

“Then what were you doing?”

“I…” I looked down at the deer’s remains, then back at him. “Trying to understand.”

He stopped. I stopped too, holding my breath. If the gator attacks, be ready to fight.

But he didn’t attack. Instead, he said, “Better the deer than you. That’s all you need to understand.” And with that, he turned and stalked off as silently as he’d come.

<hr />

For our next meal, I found a serving bowl and filled it with water. I placed it before him, then sat down in the chair to his right. “Skinned rabbits,” I said.

When the bloody platter appeared on the table, he looked at me suspiciously, clearly thinking this was some sort of mean trick.

“Go on,” I said. “You don’t gotta hide nothin’ from me.”

Slowly, he lowered his shaggy head and lapped water from the basin. Then he ate the rabbits, bones and all. When he was finished, he wiped his mouth with a linen napkin.

<hr />
  
That Sunday, he invited me to play board games in the library. Over chess, he said, “Tell me about yourself. I met your father, of course, but you mentioned a brother and sisters?”

I nodded. “My brother, Arbor, is fifteen. My sister, Lark, is eleven, and Zalie’s nine.”

“And you homeschooled them?”

“Yep. Daddy ain’t exactly what you’d call reliable, but he was good about bringing us books. Mostly science texts—botany, mycology, all that. We read ‘em all.”

“And your mother?”

“Oh, she’s laid up most of the time. She gets real bad migraines. Our granddaddy lives with us too—that’s Daddy’s daddy. He takes us to town every so often, and we get Mama some Anacin. And we got a generator, so we get fuel, too, to keep the fan going, to keep her cool.”

“You don’t have electricity?”

“No, we ain’t even got running water.”

“Where’s your father in all this?”

“Oh, he don’t live with us all the time. He’s got his own houseboat. Goes out there when he’s on a tear.”

“You said he went to Tulane?”

“Yessir, he did. When he graduated, he worked in research a while, but he said it didn’t suit him, being indoors all the time and taking orders from eggheads.”

“Does he not have a job?”

“He grows weed. That mostly keeps us going.”

“Marijuana?”

“Yep. Collects magic mushrooms, too. Sells his stuff wholesale to a dealer in New Orleans.”

The Beast shook his head. “I gave him the chance to return here. I’m glad he sent you in his place.”

“You are?”

He ducked his head. Even though his face was fuzzy, I could tell he was blushing underneath. He nodded.

It surprised both of us when I said, “Me too.”

We played games every Sunday after that. Every so often, his hand, with its velvety pads, would brush mine. Sometimes, there would be a graze of claws. Such contact brought with it an unexpected charge.

<hr />

That spring, I hung birdhouses and feeders all around the yard, set out birdbaths, planted milkweed for the butterflies. The island was so quiet. I wanted to hear birds singing in the willows, pollinators buzzing in the garden beds.

I suggested we keep bees. The Beast agreed and together, we selected a good loblolly pine to make the boxes. With the Beast’s extraordinary strength, it didn’t take any time at all for him to chop it down. He stripped to his waist to work, and it was the first time I’d ever seen so much of his body, covered in tawny, spotted fur. I caught myself wanting to reach out and stroke it, to see if it was as soft as it looked.

After the hives were in place, we both got spiffed up and had a celebratory dinner. Over dessert, the Beast told me, “I’m from St. Louis. I came here with the Army Corps of Engineers to work on the new floodgate system for the Mississippi.”

I stared at him. “But that was—”

“Nineteen sixty-one,” he nodded. “What year is it now?”

“Nineteen eighty-eight.”

The Beast looked thoughtful. “Then I’m fifty-five. How about that?”

“Do you feel old?”

“No, but it’s hard to tell if I’ve aged or not. Time passes here, yet it doesn’t. When I first came here, the residents were supposed to relocate. Everyone cleared out except for this one old woman by the name of Mama Chene. We explained to her that the area was going to be flooded, but she wouldn’t go. She had to be forcibly removed. We all felt bad about it, but what else could we have done? The next day, she caught me working alone, and turned me into <em>this</em>.” He held up his paws to illustrate. “She said I’d be cursed to stay here forever unless I find a certain rare flower.”

“So that’s what you’re looking for,” I said. “I figured you were trying to cure yourself. Did Mama Chene say what this flower looked like?”

“No. Just that it was the rarest in the land. When I find it blooming, then I’ll be free.”

“Well, pardon me for saying so, but that don’t seem like such a terrible curse to me. You’re surrounded by water and trees and all sorts of beautiful things. It ain’t exactly a prison. You’ve got everything you need.”

“Yes, everything I need,” he said, “and nothing I want. I’ve been cut off from my family and friends. Some of them are surely dead by now. I have no freedom, and until recently, no companionship. And of course, I look like this, so even if I were to escape, what sort of life would I have out there?”

I peered at him. “Did you sucker my daddy into sending me here? If you can't leave, how would you have made good on your threat to ruin his livelihood?”

“The same way I’m able to command this house and the boat. Magic.” He sighed. “You still don’t trust me, do you?”

“Kinda hard to trust a captor,” I said. “But I’m surprised I gotta tell you that.”

<hr />

Autumn came, or what passes for autumn in the South. It was more noticeable to us who watched the flora and fauna like astronomers peering through a telescope, charting the movement of the stars. The spicebush berries turned yellow. The red admiral butterflies returned. By mid-September, we harvested our first honey. I fed the Beast a piece of honeycomb and laughed as his raspy tongue licked the honey from my fingers.

<hr />

For Christmas, my unseen attendants dressed me in a crimson gown. The Beast wore a tuxedo, and we slow-danced to Nat King Cole carols before sitting down to a holiday feast.

The Beast gave me three gifts. The first was a blue bottle. Unscrewing the cap, I sniffed at the contents. “What’s this?”

“It’s for your mother, for her headaches.”

I gasped. “Really?”

He nodded.

I leaped to my feet. “I can take it to her?”

He nodded again.

That was the second gift—my freedom. Bursting into tears, I threw my arms around him. “Oh, thank you, Beast. Thank you, thank you, thank you!”

He hugged me back. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. “Henry. My name is Henry Beaumont.”

I nodded, my chin resting in the notch of his shoulder. “Henry.”

He stroked my back. “Before you go, open your other gift. Something to remember me by.”

“As if I could ever forget you.”

This third and final gift was a necklace he’d made himself-- a pressed flower in a heart-shaped setting, a violet and white succulent with a delicate golden midlobe. <em>Calanthe sylvatica</em>, a species of Christmas orchid.

“Do you like it?” he asked.

“Are you kidding me?” I laughed through my tears. “It’s perfect! I guess I never told you my real name either. It’s Calanthe. We’ve all got botanical names-- Arbor, Larkspur, and Azalea. I got Calanthe because I was due at Christmastime but came late.”

His smile was very sad. “Perfect, indeed.”

He escorted me to the blue boat right after that, clasping my hand gently before releasing it. “You’ll come back to visit me, won’t you?”

“Of course I will,” I promised.

<hr />

My homecoming was decidedly muted. We all laughed and cried and embraced, Mama, the kids and I. But then they took me to see Granddaddy. I cried out to see him in his bed, his high coloring faded to parchment, and skinny as a dandelion with all the fluff blown off.

I looked around. The house looked exactly the same as when I left it. “Where’s Daddy?” I asked Mama.

She shrugged.

“He ever sell them orchids?”

“If he did, I never saw no money.”

What else could I do, but stay and take care of everyone? The Beast’s potion did cure Mama of her headaches, though she was still frail after years of debilitating, chronic pain. It would take time for her to build herself up. Meanwhile, the kids were thrilled to have me back—Arbor didn’t have much patience for tutoring the girls after all, and of course, there was Granddaddy. I did what I could to make him comfortable, running back and forth to town to fetch him his medications, feeding him soft foods and bottles of Ensure, helping him with bathing and the bedpan.

He passed on St. Patrick’s Day. Daddy managed to show up a few days before, and hadn’t had a sober moment since. (He didn’t look any better off than usual, so I assume he’d drunk up or gambled away whatever money he might’ve made off selling the flowers. Flowers that came from a magic bayou, the likes of which might never be seen again, just pissed down the drain. God truly does love a fool.) We wrapped Granddaddy in a shroud and carried him out to the boat to take him to the mainland. A graveside service was held at the parish cemetery. Afterwards, friends and neighbors gathered at the house, bringing pots of gumbo, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice, and cases of beer. Someone put on an old zydeco record.

I sat outside on the porch swing, heartsick and weary to my very bones. To my surprise, Daddy brought me a cup of tea sweetened with honey. While I sipped it, he sat down beside me. “You miss him?” he asked.

I didn’t answer. Mama must’ve told him about my time with the Beast. When I’d returned, they’d all been impressed with how well I looked, all decked out in my Christmas finery. I’d tucked everything away in the dresser, the red dress carefully folded, the jewels wrapped in a handkerchief. Even the shoes I’d been wearing had been studded with crystals. I’d intended to return it all to the Beast. None of it was mine. Not really. Only the orchid necklace belonged to me, which I never took off.

Daddy had something sparkly in his hand, running it between his fingers. A diamond bracelet. “Can’t say I blame ya. I’d miss somebody who gave me diamonds too.”

“You give that back!” I made a grab for the bracelet, spilling what was left of my tea. I missed—missed by a mile. That’s when I realized I’d come over funny. A heavy, sinking sensation stole over my limbs. Suspicious, I looked at the tea soaking into the floorboards. When I spoke, my words came out slow and slurry. “What’d you do?”

Daddy laughed. “Now, don’t be sore. It’s a mercy, really.”

Groping for the railing, I tried to stand. “What’d you give me?”

“Just a little Benzodiazepine. Perfectly safe. But all that wealth really oughta be in the hands of somebody who needs it. Somebody like me. I got obligations.”

I sank to one knee. “Gambling debts, you mean?”

Daddy said something to that, but I didn’t hear it. The darkness rushed up to swallow me, and I heard nothing at all.

<hr />

It was pitch-dark when I woke up, sprawled on the sofa in the front room. Groggy, I sat up, kicking over some beer cans in the process. There were paper plates everywhere. That made me remember—Granddaddy’s funeral. Daddy. The tea.

“Henry,” I whispered. How much of a head start did Daddy have? Knowing him, he would’ve rallied a few of his buddies to come help.

I was still trying to gather myself when a faint blue light appeared, right there in the front room. It grew larger and brighter until, at last, it resolved itself into the form of an old woman.

“Mama Chene?” I whispered.

“That’s right, girl,” she replied. “The flower’s blooming.”

“It is? Where is it?”

Reaching out a spectral hand, she touched the orchid necklace at my throat. “If you wanna save him, Calanthe, you best hurry.”

If I hadn’t already been knocked out once that evening, that surely would’ve done it. Why hadn’t I figured it out sooner? “But why?” I asked the old woman. “Why’re you helping me?”

She smiled. “I wanted him to learn to love this land. I wanted him to know what it felt like to love something and then lose it. Through you, he’s done both.”

I suspected I was going to need all the help I could get. I woke up Arbor, then went to Granddaddy’s room and grabbed his old snake slayer, a Smith & Wesson .357, out of the chifforobe.

Mama Chene led the way, her light glimmering just as the lights in the Beast’s house had once glimmered for me. Arbor and I followed in the skiff. She took us through the swamp, back to the hidden green tunnel—only now, the tunnel was brown and dead. The wisteria did not bloom, nor did anything else. By the time we reached the Beast’s bayou, it was nearly dawn. The closer we got, the worse everything looked: the water stagnant and foul, the island overgrown with toxic foxglove, devil’s darning needles and suicide root. The bee boxes were vacant, the birdhouses and feeders knocked to the ground.

Three boats were tethered to the bank nearest the stone staircase—Daddy’s pirogue, and a pair of larger flatboats that belonged to some of his shadier associates. All three vessels were already laden with treasures—jewels, silver, paintings, furnishings, more rare plants. Anything that wasn’t nailed down.

Arbor and I were still a few yards from the island when we heard a terrible ruckus going on up on the top floor—shouts, roaring, gunfire. Then silence.

I gripped my brother’s arm. “Oh God. We’re too late.”

He patted my hand. “Sounds like your man put up one helluva fight.”

We’d both forgotten the little blue light flickering next to us, scarcely bigger than a gas stove flame. All of the sudden, it crackled and shot forward, streaking toward the island like a comet. It circled the house from its foundation stones to the topmost turret. In its wake, the walls of the house began to soften and grow dark. In a moment, the entire structure was silt-brown.

It had all turned to mud.

When the blue light reached its apex, it flared like a star going nova, and then it was gone. Just vanished into the paling sky. The house held its shape for just a moment, over four stories of mud swaying above our heads. Arbor and I started paddling backwards, afraid it was going to come down on top of us.

Instead, the heap collapsed inward, turning the island into a giant mud pit. Runoff spilled over the banks and into the water.

From somewhere in all that muck, three human figures rose, groaning and flailing, trying to fight their way free. Sinking down on all fours, their bodies grew round as kegs, their hands and feet fusing into ungulate hooves. They sprouted tails and snouts. Then, instead of three men, it was three hogs floundering in the pit, squealing their indignation. On the muddied shore, their stolen riches also turned to sludge, their boats sinking beneath the weight of it.

Still slathered in filth, the pigs scurried as fast as their little trotters would carry them to the water’s edge. They dove in and swam away. The swamps were full of wild pigs; they wouldn’t be lonely.

Meanwhile, a fourth human rose from the pit. The mud was up to his knees, but he remained mostly upright as he waded through it, staggering in our general direction. Mud streamed off him. It ran into his eyes, into his mouth as he opened it, trying to call out. Finally, he, too, tumbled into the water.

Arbor and I had hurried over. As some of the mud washed away, I saw those blue eyes I knew so well. I also saw the bullet wound in his left shoulder.

“Callie,” he said, relieved, as we helped him into the boat.

He was bleeding pretty good, but it was a clean shot. As long as it didn’t get infected, he’d be golden. I put pressure on the wound while Arbor paddled us homeward.

Wiping some more of the mud away, I saw Henry’s face, fur-free and one hundred percent human. When I kissed him, I tasted salt and river silt. “You’re free now,” I said. “You can go wherever you want.”

He touched the orchid at my throat. “I’m right where I’m supposed to be.”

#### The Noble Gases

The voice that is dry leaves and plush essences.
A voice from the dreamworld warning it can’t be done.
Time sulking under the willows.

I still hear the wind around the door of your name,
pushing and pulling the snowfelt evening,
delivering its parcels, pining for Phoebe Reggio,
bemoaning the dullard in me.

I can still hear your voice and the doves’ language,
speaking the river’s lingo and cant,
insisting insisting . . .

The tongue of rare elements and noble gases,
small-talk gnawing on its sweetened straw.
The voice lost among fields of cane,
a few grains remaining
in Mr. Mnemonics’ storehouse of plenty.

Where did you go when you went there?
Voice like a swallow’s swoop and ship’s lantern.
A voice pitched like a memory jarred.
Like a storm coming
and the heart’s sailor longing for safe harbour.

#### Art, For Pete's Sake

Mondrian's tree.<em> What about it?</em>
I was just looking at it. <em>And?</em>
I was just thinking. <em>Yes, you were.</em>
It's very . . . treelike. <em>It's very like a tree.</em>
But it isn't a tree. No, it isn't.
As if from life, but once removed.
<em>Art is life at a remove.</em>
It's not the real article at all, is it?
<em>It's not really real, no.</em>
The hand copies what the eye sees.
<em>The hand, I'd say, copies the mind.</em>
Of course! Which copies what the eyes see.
<em>Pretty much. Tree. Eye. Mind. Hand.</em>
And the actual painting itself.
<em>And there's that too.</em>
The five stages of art.
<em>Or the five levels, plus the viewer.</em>
And their eyes, and their minds.
<m>It's getting complicated, isn't it?</m>
Surely. Then it must be difficult to be
"genuine" as far as the artist is concerned.
<em>Perhaps "impossible" is the word;</em>
<em>the original subject-tree could be</em>
<em>thought of as genuine though.</em>
And here I thought it was a painting of a tree!
<em>Or very like one.</em>

#### N equals N

According to the emperor’s new
physics zero possibly doesn’t
exist and God may or may not be
reduced to a short-lived particle.

A thing is, and a thing isn’t.
Very real. And completely fabricated.

On the blackboard is a formula
only the devil might solve –
he who resides beneath a decimal.
And the physicist, naked as a bone,
rubbing his imponderable chin,
tapping a mental pencil
against his greying temple –
because X matters.

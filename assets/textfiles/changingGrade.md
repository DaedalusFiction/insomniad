Why was such an extraordinary student silent in class, invisible in lectures, and indifferent to grades? After Berkeley’s Commencement on a sunny Mother’s Day weekend, final grades were now due. The professor intended to enter the student’s A+. He found that he couldn’t because ‘Foster, Lee’ was registered P/NP in <i>Current Cosmology - What do we know NOW about the Universe -- and HOW?</i> Vijay couldn’t call up the student’s image, but he could see that the senior’s work all semester had been, no other word for it, perfect. He frowned for not noticing sooner. What was he, the kind of teacher he never believed could actually exist?

GOOD WILL HUNTING was a film he despised for its incredible depiction of genius overlooked. Neither his school teachers in Massachusetts nor his wife Ruthie’s in California would’ve missed a Matt Damon. Vijay believed that from sea to shining sea, teachers rejoiced in rarity as much as any astronomer discovering a new star. He looked at the framed photos on his Campbell Hall desk: he and his wife had been recognized early. At four years old, Vijay had mapped constellations, and Ruthie astonished her parents by effortlessly “fixing” their Rubik’s Cube. And now, their curly-haired Dhanya <i>(Thankful, Lucky)</i> was only two years old; a pyramid ‘cube’ was the toddler’s favorite toy though its sharp apex worried Ruthie. But at five, their blue-eyed son David struggled to sit upright.

Affected individuals usually have delayed development of speech and language by age two. About one-third of individuals with fragile X syndrome have features of autism spectrum disorders. Seizures occur in about fifteen percent of males. Most males with fragile X syndrome have characteristic physical features that include a long and narrow face, large ears, a prominent jaw and forehead, unusually flexible fingers, flat feet, and in males, enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) after puberty.</i></blockquote>

A decade earlier, Vijay and Ruthie had met and found careers at Berkeley. Ruthie’s office was in the Math Department in the building beside Astronomy’s Campbell Hall.

Vijay wandered next door to a colleague’s office. Eve looked up from a screen similarly filled with grades.

“What’s troubling you on such a fine day in May? I welcome the clouds after such a blinding weekend. Too much of your Sun!”

“To being with, finding this student was like identifying a planetary transit. No social media, unanswered phone/email,” Vijay said. “The Registrar was bureaucratically unforthcoming with anything additional. I left her message after message, and finally ‘Foster, Lee’ texted. She was singularly disinterested in a grade change/status. Why?”

“And why do you care? <i>Deux vrais mysteres! Ecce homo</i> AND <i>cherchez la femme</i>,” Eve malapropped.

“She agreed to discuss it.”

“<i>Comment dit-on</i> the plot thickens?”

<hr/>

Foster, Lee [how Vijay thought of her] appeared in his office the next day after lunch. He offered his hand, and she shook it and sat down without invitation. She removed the heavy course textbook from her backpack and placed it on her lap. Chino shorts, a white shirt, new sockless running shoes. Vijay also sat down, trying to remember her, but his thoughts felt unsettled, as did his stomach. Maybe the cafeteria sushi?

He felt himself blinking as he did when exhausted during overnights staring at screen data. He tried to get the graduate into focus. She gave the compact, taut impression of a pit bull or a Marine. Vijay felt neither attraction nor repulsion, only curiosity at the absence of both. <i>What</i> was s/he? ‘They?’ He knew he was clumsy with the steps of the current pronoun dance. Bound to step on toes.

<blockquote>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/fashion/pronoun-confusion-sexual-fluidity.html <i><strong>She? Ze? They?

Vijay thought, how trendy of Foster, Lee to be non-gender specific. Infants and the elderly were unidentifiable by sex, reproduction being irrelevant to both. Foster, Lee was <i>Neither this nor that</i>. Albino? At a glance, yes, but then, immediately, ‘they’ were a deep tan, chameleon-like. Looked Asian, no, African, no, Irish. Long hair was wavy, was straight, was shiny, then dull. Pulled back in a gender-free ponytail. Foster, Lee made Vijay feel like he was in a kaleidoscope, looking out, not in. It had to be the sushi. His hand went to his stomach. He looked out the window at the cloudy sky. It offered no bearings.

“Professor,” they said.

Neither a question nor statement. Just three syllables of sound. Phonemes. He called up their grades on his tablet.

Vijay avoided addressing them by name. “Something I ate. Never mind. Congratulations on this weekend. Family enjoyed it?”

“Not in attendance,” Foster, Lee said.

He looked up from the screen in surprise; the movement made him seasick.

“Why not?”

A pause, then they shrugged.

“You’re a remarkable student. If I were to say so – and I’d very much like to say so on your behalf. Why aren’t you interested in getting an A+? I wish I could add + to the nth.”

“Your saying…so…creates opportunities,” they acknowledged.

He frowned at their pauses, brief as a caught breath. Vijay recognized the behavior of dumbing down explanations for students or instantly translating from Hindi. His mother still sometimes hesitated assertively just like that.

“Opportunities don’t matter to you?”

“It…depends.”

Vijay thought the pause was perhaps a tic of some kind. Nausea distracted him.

Foster, Lee stood up and walked to the window. Turning away from the professor, they placed their heavy textbook on the sill. They were outlined in cloudy light. Their low tenor voice and pauses became hypnotic.

“We read an anecdote that you created for a paper a long time ago… that describes a field of poppies with the power to choose… which bees to satisfy. Some bees came for pollen only…some for pollen and H2O… some for either/both, but also… some for something else the poppies had… that they didn’t even know they had, but they knew… when <i>those</i> bees lighted on them. They preferred those bees and unconsciously… did something that kept those bees longer. The poppies and those bees lingered longer together… and the bees never told… when they returned to the hive. The bees didn’t include the poppies in their dance... Only those who randomly arrived… seeking the ineffable without expecting it… were welcomed and embraced.”

Vijay took his hand from his mouth. “Blue poppies.”

Foster, Lee turned and faced him. “So they were.”

“Words like ‘ineffable’ and ‘qualia’ lack evidence. Which one of us is the poppy, which the bee?”

“A two-dimensional question.”

Silencing a defensive retort, Vijay looked at the numbers on his screen. He felt more curious than angry, and more nauseated than either. Foster, Lee walked to his desk and picked up the photo of David propped up in Ruthie’s lap. Both blue-eyed and brave, but otherwise jarringly dissimilar.

“Hey,” Vijay said.

“If you could, would you correct your son’s genetic effect? Pinocchio wanted to be a real live boy.”

Vijay expected to feel righteous indignation. Rage. Instead, he calmly considered standing and dismissing them. But neither action felt possible, which was the most remarkable aspect of the situation.

“I’ve had many students with questionable aspect, but you –” he felt himself imitating the pause – “you’re not even rude. You’re –”

“Questionable.”

“I see no point in questions whose answers cannot be tested. ‘If <u>you</u> could…then it becomes a moral question for me? Is that what you want to know? What is your motive in all this? What is your basis in evidence?”

“<i>Motive</i> is two-dimensional. For evidence, we could repeat Mohammed’s flight to and from Mecca in six hours. In less…time than that.”

“<u>We</u> could? Evidence of your miraculous powers?” Vijay laughed, but it coughed up fishy stomach acid. “Convince me with a burning bush? You’re wrong on both religions where I’m concerned, and all religion.” Dizzy, he added, “Do I get three wishes in this delusion? What might work with me is a trip inside DNA to see David’s FOXG1 mutation site. Or better, on an axion of dark matter. I know, while we’re dreaming, how about unlimited time with the LRIS at Keck to observe reionization of galaxies?”

“If you become convinced, then you may change the grade.”

“Is that my motive? Curiouser and curiouser,” Vijay said. “<i>What</i> are you What is <i>this</i>?”

Foster, Lee made no reply. There was a sudden total alteration of location. In the same clothes, with the same stomach upset, Vijay stood beside them at an archeological site. They both squinted in hard sunlight. The air was desert dry and hot.

Vijay breathed, “Toto, I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore.”

“You’re curious about Gobekli Tepi,” they said.

It was true that Vijay had seen a PBS episode about the pre-pottery/agriculture Neolithic site in southeastern Turkey where circular stone structures and giant stone pillars stood older than Stonehenge by 6000 years and the oldest pyramids by 7000. Built not by a settled community but by hunter gatherers. Feeding the numbers necessary to the monumental architecture was evidence that up-ended the order of what came first, the chicken or the egg, agriculture/ settlement or religion. Vijay looked down at his brown leather docksiders. The sky was cloudless blue. The air smelled strange and blew in hot gusts. Foster, Lee stood beside him. They now wore a visored sunhat. Vijay touched his head. So did he. The pronouns or heat gave him a headache.

Apparently unseen by the workers below them at a distance of several hundred yards, Vijay watched a scene similar to what he’d streamed on TV. As he watched, trying to make sense of his senses, a clear scrim-like, what, curtain?, appeared, and through it he could also see – and smell – incredibly! -- New Stone Age people working in the same space below on what was apparently the site at its building. The title of the topic of his most recent paper– he’d flown to England to present it, between semesters in January -- came to mind: <i>Understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies</i>. The scrim translated that in his mind – how? – so he heard <i>Understanding the formation and evolution of Gobekli Tepi.</i>

He couldn’t believe he was seeing what was before him, two time periods superimposed on one another, echoed by a kind of voiceover related to his work. He concentrated on breathing calmly as the best way to regain sanity.

But he gasped at the sight of one of two huge carved stone T pillars, presumably idols, being raised by five teams of – he counted – twenty sweating men each, hauling thick ropes. The stench of them reached him on greasy smoke. He gagged. Moments before the scrim had appeared, Vijay had seen both those monoliths in place being laboriously <u>unearthed</u>. Dug up. Brushes and sieves and other tools he couldn’t name.

Vijay’s eyes shut, and he turned away from Foster, Lee. He bent over and vomited. His hand was at his mouth, wiping foul wetness away. He resisted inhaling the several odors as he slowly unbent himself, but involuntarily, when he breathed and stood upright, before he opened his eyes, he registered a new shock: familiar scent, academic office air. California, NOW. He blinked and collapsed into his desk chair. Foster, Lee stood facing him at an angle that imitated the narrow side of one stone monolith – their hands positioned to meet above its belted waist.

Vijay’s eyes focused on the textbook still on the windowsill. The sky was still gray outside. He touched the top of his head. No hat.

“Are there limits to what you can do?”

Their expression looked the way he’d felt when playing chess with his younger brother. When it got too boring, Vijay had turned the board around to improve his brother’s position and then when Susheel had wandered away to sulk, played the rest of the game by himself. Time for sibling shame later; anxious curiosity overcame Vijay.

“Can you reverse Fragile X Syndrome? All genetic deviations? What are you?”

They sighed. “Enzyme. Substrate.”

“What? You’re a catalyst? Like the CNO cycle of star nucleosynthesis? Or a fairytale? Are you Rumplestiltskin? Am I The Fisherman’s Wife? I ask for too much and you take away everything? Poppies and bees. Right, too two-dimensional for you. This is crazy. I’m crazy. If I hadn’t contacted you about your grade, would any of this…but verb tenses are irrelevant. If I ask or answer incorrectly - immorally - does the fabric of spacetime fray?”

They stood up, returned to the window, picked up the textbook and by all indications, intended to leave the office. Vijay panicked. A burst of energy rushed him to block the door. They paused.

“You <u>chose</u> to take my seminar,” Vijay rasped. “You chose me. Why? But I chose to contact you. Did I choose? Did you? All dimensionally-challenged, irrelevant questions? I can’t even see the chessboard. Is there a chessboard? Yes, it’s been torture -- if I could repair David? When he was born, the question was a fantasy, an escape. Then, without hesitation, yes, but now? He’s five years old. He’s … David. But now, you? <i>If</i> can be <i>then</i>? Why not all the others? If you can teach us all how, what -- but, David.”

Vijay stopped. His mouth was dry. His heart thudded. He was breathing too fast but he spoke slowly.

“It is not a moral question for me anymore. Yes. I would…do… anything…to save him…future suffering. You know better than I how ignorant I am. But I know…<u>that</u>. It’s a reflex, like grabbing him back from a crash,” Vijay’s arm moved as if a marionette’s. He looked at it. “It’s a reflex.”

Then he couldn’t even manage the few steps back to his chair. He couldn’t breathe. His fingertips tingled. Hyperventilation. He sank to the floor. Panicked, he looked up into their eyes.

They looked down at him. “All right,” they soothed and then repeated, “Enzyme. Substrate.”

The words were a meaningless aphasic echo to Vijay. He felt the blissful memory of the first IV infusion of water administered in the hospital when he was fevered and dehydrated, the distraction from the agony of acute appendicitis. He was fifteen years old. Relief. Unconsciousness.

<hr/>

“<i>Bonjour, ca va?</i>" Eve said.

She made her way towards Vijay across his backyard at the July 4th barbecue. She balanced a drink and a plate of food as a breeze threatened her straw sunhat.

The noise of colleagues’ children filled the wooden swing set/playhouse/climbing wall. Dhanya was being pushed on one of the toddler swings.

“She <u>is</u> a lucky girl! Hey, did you ever change that grade?” Eve asked him.

Vijay was in mid-bite of a long hot dog. Puzzled, he frowned at Eve, but quickly grinned when he saw David catch a frisbee tossed to him by an older child. His son’s beauty and skill were obvious.

“I don’t know where he gets his athletic ability,” Vijay said.

His wife brought him a red, white, and blue cup of many-cubed iced tea.

“He gets his brains and looks from me,” Ruthie said.

“Oh, Eve, you mean that odd duck,” Vijay said. “I had some food poisoning that day! Wound up in the hospital overnight.”

Ruthie grimaced. “It’s a blur. I don’t like to think about it.”

Vijay chugged his iced tea to reassure her and added, “I can’t remember it at all! About that grade, <i>mais oui, copaine,</i> with ‘their’ approval I changed it to an A+. Congruence is a beautiful thing. ‘They’ even asked me for a recommendation for grad school. Easiest rec ever. Wrote itself.”

“In astronomy?” Eve asked.

“No. Biology. ‘They’re’ interested in genetic research.”

“Oh, yes, that was the pronoun-gender whiz-kid,” Ruthie said. “I remember ‘them’!”

But between you and us, really, no one ever does, any more than fish notice ocean or birds see the sky.

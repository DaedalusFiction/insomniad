Party gone wild.
The exit door was ajar,
the conversation filtered to the street.
The silent anger made me sick.
I couldn’t move or think.

I disliked dresses and cars
but reeled off the titles
of metaphysical novels,
reliving the past triumphs
with apathetic shrugs
and the impunity of the daydreamer,
sipped mint juleps.

No irony,
no derision,
no cultural standards
could explain
what happened next.
Totally out of context
of classical texts
I was raped and shot.

They caught him
in my friend’s house.
The lockdown was lifted.
My ashes were scattered
from the Rotunda.

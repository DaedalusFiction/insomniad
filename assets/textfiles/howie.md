#### Childhood's End

How would you describe your pain? Stabbing? Aching? Sharp? Dull? I would describe mine as a skeletal tree with twisted limbs rattling in the wind. Every day seems a bad imitation of the day before. If I look ahead, I see myself walking on corpses instead of the ground, and if I look back, I see night and fog, and my father angrily clenching the steering wheel and my mother locked in cold silence beside him, while alone in the backseat, I watch through the side window the black-veiled moon follow us home.

#### The State of Poetry

A poet whose work I admire announces on Facebook the recurrence of her brain tumor. Another has already been admitted to hospice care. A third, a clear case of burnout, is giving up writing to attend mortuary school. And people wonder if poetry is dead!

Then there are the times when I feel cast out, abandoned, a mutineer marooned on a speck in the ocean and forced to watch from far off as words, like the black ships of Magellan’s armada, their sails puffed out and all their flags flying, plunge over the edge of the world.

#### The Mystical Birth of Endangered Species

A girl was born to parents who belonged to a race of giants. As fast as the baby grew, her appetite grew even faster until, finally, it became insupportable. The parents rowed her out to sea in a canoe and dropped her overboard. When she grabbed onto the side of the canoe to keep from drowning, the parents chopped at her fingers with hunting knives. The sea seethed as each finger splashed into the water and transformed into a creature – a seal, a walrus, a whale. Ridiculous, right? Just keep telling and telling and telling the story.

#### Paper Tiger

The strangest part was cutting out the fingers. Using my hands to make my hands. I felt a real sense of fragility as I cut the rounded fragments of my pinkies, dipped the paper in the glue mix, and formed them around a blown-up glove.

I looked the papier mâché version of myself in the eyes and said to it, “thank you for being so patient.” Its hollow face just kept staring off into the distance, a slight smirk across its paper lips.

I finished the final touches and dressed it like myself. I gave it black jeans and a random t-shirt, placed its arms through the sleeves of my favorite black hoodie.

I taught him how to walk, then I taught him how to run (I wanted him to be safe in case of an emergency) and after a long day of human lessons, I took him home and I taught him how to dance. That was by far the best part. I asked him if he’d be willing to put on an Earth, Wind & Fire record, and he agreed to, and we danced around the living room to “September”. My feet stomping around the wooden floors, his whole being light as air. He was a terrible dancer, but in the same way that so many of us are.

Throughout the fall, I integrated him into my social circles. Sent him to parties when I was home, sick in bed. He mostly took the bus from place to place. We tried driving but it was very stressful. He didn’t need to eat or sleep, but I still made a nice bed for him on the couch each night where he could rest, or at least not have to be so concerned with doing things for a while. I felt like I’d appreciate that opportunity.

One morning in winter, we put on our jackets and walked around the park. I told him I was leaving the next day. I told him it was too much for me. All of this performance, all of this being. I told him I had bought a plane ticket and a ride to the wilderness of Alaska. That I had a trailer there with all that I would need. I told him I didn’t intend to come back. I knew it was dark up there, but that is what I wanted for now. I need a kind of incubation. I need a space of unlearning. He nodded.

The next day, I was gone. I wondered if he set an alarm without me. I wondered what he did first that first morning. I arrived at Denver International Airport before the sun rose. I looked around at all of the people, buying a bagel, or purchasing some dozy medicine for a long flight, waiting in line for the restroom. They all seemed so resolute in their doing. I looked down at my hand, and I swear my hand looked like it was made of paper.

#### and i open another door and

and i open another door and it’s a door
it’s just a door behind the door and it’s
locked

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and i open another door and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s you and you’re slipping out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my hoodie and my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a strike-anywhere match
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you are the anywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that i am striking against

and i open another door
and there is an opera in
the snowfall and a man
who sings like an angel
pulls out a gun and fires
like the devil himself
and i catch the bullet
between my teeth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and i open another door and it’s a cartoon train but i
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;close the door and the train is not so cartoon when it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comes through and tackles me like a buffalo that has
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been fed hunger and when i wake up i am sore every
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where and at the foot of my bed is a buffalo bleeding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out and i cannot find the room where i keep my tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all of these doors these doors forever

and i
i open
another door and
there
there beyond the door is god
and god is all like

hey
you’re just gonna keep writing me
into all of these poems, huh?
and i say to god

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you’ll keep having me.

and god says
you know that it was me
who killed the buffalo
and it was me who fired the gun
and it was me
and it was me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and i says to god, listen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i know it wasn’t you and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can’t be a martyr
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forever and i says to god
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you know who it was who
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killed the buffalo and who
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fired the gun

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was men who were too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid that if they open
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another door, it would be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you that they saw.

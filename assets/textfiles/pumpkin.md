It was half-past midnight when Swede, the fattest turnip, plopped down the chimney and landed on the hearth between his brothers, Lathe and Neep. Together, the trio’s carved faces let off the only light in the musty, one-room shack.

“Who’s playing John tonight?” asked Swede.

“Rutie,” replied Neep. “Or was it Bayga?”

“Shh,” said Lathe. “He’s wakin’ again.”

A man in the corner bed sat up, shook his jowls, and cowered under his quilt.

“Nay, say it isn’t so,” said the man. “There was but two of ye’s an hour ago!”

“Yessss,” said Lathe. “What’d you expect spending the night in an abandoned shack ya geezer?”

“And soon,” Swede interrupted. “John’ll be upon ye.”

Neep whispered to his fellow turnips:

“Cool it, guys. Remember: subtly.”

“Nay, I’ll not have it!” the old man screamed, leaping from bed. “You tell that John o’ the Lanterns he shan’t be havin’ ol’ Howard Lubert for company.”

The man then burst through the door and fled into the night.

“Son of a bitch!” cried Neep. “What’d I say?”

“Hey, I stuck to the script!” grunted Swede. “What about all that ‘spending the night’ crap, Lathe?”

“Don’t look at me,” Lathe countered. “No one ever stays for the finale these days.”

An especially haunting groan issued from up the chimney. Moments later a fourth turnip, the most monstrous of them all, landed among the cold embers.

“Behold mortal,” it cried. “I am the wicked John o’—”

“Can it, Rutie,” Neep snapped. “He left already.”

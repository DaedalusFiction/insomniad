### How to never be alone in your twenties.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> None of this may be true.

<strong>The definition of a relationship:</strong> the way in which two or more people or groups regard and behave toward each other.

<strong>The definition of a “relationship”:</strong> two committed people in love and/or having sex with each other.

In the beginning there is one. One man or woman who desperately wants to be two. Unless that’s not true.

Perhaps the one man or woman just wants to feel the presence of another man or woman. In which case, maybe the other half doesn&rsquo;t matter. Or is interchangeable. Or eventually becomes three.

Before a relationship becomes a “relationship” there are several steps that, post-baby-boomer, are now necessary to finding “the one”. This narrowing of the selection often comes after the Friends With Benefits stage.

#### Making New Friends

For those who can’t stand the idea of scrolling through photos, people, and dating apps, the FWB situation is the easiest alternative.

1. Pick a person you could be attracted to.
2. Become friends, but not too-good of friends. Just friendly enough to talk about relationships, but just gendered enough that you’re never alone together.
3. Have sex.

If the sex is good, the Friends With Benefits stage can successfully continue for up to two months. After two months, it becomes either a “relationship”, too awkward to bear, or too comfortable to leave. If the FWB arrangement continues past two months, the relationship eventually turns to It’s Complicated.

One or both parties do not particularly want to introduce their partner to friends or family, but they also don’t want to be alone. They may enjoy the use of one person’s apartment or simply hate dating.

The truly tricky part about this stage is that it can’t last forever. Usually one person wants to be “official.”

If the other person continues to want to sleep together, but does not want to be exclusive, Complicated can quickly become single.

#### And Then There Were Three

By introducing the concept of polyamory, the partner who does not want to end the relationship, but does not want to become exclusive, can place a title on the complication to make it a different kind of official.

Unfortunately, the partner who agrees to a polyamorous relationship will likely want a different kind of official at some point in the near future. Perhaps they’ll want the same kind of “official” they originally intended. This may lead to a showdown: an exclusive relationship or a breakup.

To avoid being alone, the partner who suggested polyamory must begin the search for his or her next partner while still sleeping with the original partner. This can temporarily lead to some alone time while finding another prospect. Instead of scrolling through photographs, dating apps, and people, it&rsquo;s easiest to find a new friend.

#### Happily Ever After

If a new friend-interest becomes involved with a non-monogamous couple, they’re probably not looking for exclusivity. This is a great time. For one to two months.

After two months with the new and more attractive friend-interest, the original partner may get jealous.

He or she didn’t really want to be in a polyamorous relationship to begin with and they were thinking about a showdown sooner or later anyway. With the old partner gone, only the new friend-interest will remain.

Since the new friend-interest was not interested in a monogamous relationship in the first place, this is a risky spot for those who can’t be alone. If the friend-interest does not want monogamy, it is likely she or he has other friends. Friendly friends. Friends with benefits.

Before the new friend-interest finds his or herself a new friend-interest, keeping an active lifestyle is crucial. Going to the gym and hitting the bar are just two ways to find new friends.

The seventh rain fell for eighteen straight days, the scent of cinnamon growing stronger each morning, and Freddie knew that was a bad sign.

“I’m telling you,” Freddie said at the window, “it’s going to happen this time. We’ve gotta go.”

“You worry too much,” Jack said from the couch. A mangled hand stretched out and scratched his thigh. During the fifth rain, Jack had lost movement in his left arm, his fingers during the sixth. The long dirty fingernail of a twisted pinkie scratched a pair of khaki shorts. Bathing was too dangerous.

“Need your scratcher?”

“I’m fine.”

Freddie turned back to the window. Light hurt Jack’s eyes and Freddie kept the curtains closed at all times. He wrinkled his nose. “Close your eyes. I’m heading out.”

Freddie grabbed a raincoat from the hook by the door. It was hanging beside Jack’s and, Freddie reflected, Jack would have to find a way to maneuver himself into it, if it happened this time, and they had to leave.

“Ready?”

Jack wiggled his pinkie. The man’s thumbs were frozen in hooks, bulges between his knuckles stretching his dry, unwashed skin. He closed his eyes.

Freddie slipped into his raincoat. It was heavy and thick. A woodland green with velcro pockets from the collar to the bottom seam. He zipped the raincoat and buttoned it, pressing the flap over the button to seal it last. Then he raised his hood, pulling the facemask down, sealing the protective screen over his face.

He opened the door and stepped outside.

The trailer sat on a dirt lot overlooking the valley. When the first rain fell, Freddie had thought, like everyone else, that the valley would fill like a bathtub, giving the town a good Noah drowning. Even during the second rain, Freddie anticipated a full valley and reports of death. It wasn’t until the third rain that he learned to adjust his expectations.

Not one drop dampened the ground. The dirt as dry as ever. A one-lane blacktop road led from the trailer, winding like a rattlesnake down into the valley. No rainwater gathered on the pavement and Freddie’s eyes burned from the sun.

The sky was blue. The rains poured from an unseen source and after the latest round of guesswork Freddie had quit watching the news. He preferred the radio, a station just over the border predicting the coming of the rains. Nature tipped its hand in various ways, but the most reliable was the scent of cinnamon, and Freddie took a whiff.

No doubt. It was indeed stronger. Was it going to happen this time? Freddie had thought for sure the fifth rain would bring it upon them, and the fifth rain quit and the sixth rain fell and here they were, the seventh rain and a feeling too antique to verbalize, but he knew what he knew.

Something was watching him. He took another whiff. Yes.

This was it. The seventh rain.

There would not be an eighth.

<hr/>

Freddie tracked no water inside and hung up his raincoat on the hook beside Jack’s. Both he’d purchased during the second rain, in those still-rosy days when people thought the rains would stop, and life would continue as it had before.

When did people come to terms with the new reality? Freddie was an early-adopter, but if not for Jack, he might have persisted in denial. He’d grabbed the raincoats when they were free, a miracle of science. Before the rationing and price-gouging.

“Are you hungry?” Freddie asked.

Jack shook his head as much as he could. If not for Jack...denial, fantasy more pleasant than reality. But sooner or later denial gave way to acceptance, and reality collected what it was owed.

“I can turn on the TV,” Freddie said.

“Oh there’s nothing on there worth watching.” Jack laughed, about the only part of him like the normal Jack. How long before that too stopped? “Clueless fear-mongers.”

“I could stream something.”

Jack grunted. A noise that spoke loud and clear: I don’t want anything.

Freddie stopped in the kitchen. He blinked, his eyes adjusting to the dark. He spotted the cutting board and the knife by the sink, the cupboard above it. A pot of old coffee turning bitter. Their life here, waiting for normal to reassert itself.

“What if it’s real this time?” Freddie asked without turning around. The curtain was too big for the window above the sink; when he washed dishes, he had to roll it up.

“You say that every time.”

“It feels different this time. The scent’s stronger.”

“It does not matter to me,” Jack said, enunciating each word to drive the point home. “Is the juice still there?”

“Yes,” Freddie said without checking.

“Then I’ll be fine. Don’t you worry about me. God knows there’s enough to worry about already.”

Freddie headed over to the coffee maker, and poured himself a cup. He sipped and licked his lips, savoring the bitter taste. Stray grinds got stuck between his teeth. He let them stay, and opened the back door. This room he’d added on himself, between the first and second rains. Other people didn’t prepare so early, but Freddie told himself he was able to handle any contingency.

Sunlight slanted over the garden through barred windows, pouring through a skylight and bathing the garden in an angelic light. Before the rains Freddie never imagined he’d have a green thumb, but the rains had shown what people were capable of.

Freddie unhooked a burlap sack from beside the door—a grab from the local Vons in between the second and third rains—and stuffed two carrots inside. He pulled the drawstring taut and back in the kitchen he opened the freezer and set the beef out on the counter to unthaw.

He went back to the living room. “Jack. Jack?”

Jack was sprawled on the couch, his eyes closed. Freddie rushed over to him, hesitating to touch, and settling for a finger under his nose. When the familiar warm breath tickled his index finger, Freddie sighed and dropped down on the couch himself, keeping his distance.

The bulge in Jack’s back was the most prominent. That was the bulge that robbed him of his ability to walk and the last time Jack took a bath, he slipped. Freddie offered to help, but like always Jack waved him off, a grim smile and his eyes, hopeful despite everything.

Freddie’s eyes watered. He mouthed the words along with Jack.

<em>I’m disabled, not dead.</em>

And later, as Freddie was listening to the second rain fall and like everyone else reassuring himself that in a year the rains would be a strange blip in history, Jack’s scream had torn through the trailer. <em>I’m fine, I’m fine</em>, Jack had fallen in the tub; the bulge behind his knee had seen to it.

Freddie watched him rest. How much longer? He looked at the raincoat. Jack’s left leg no longer straightened, bent like he was stretching his quads. The raincoat would cover his chest and his stomach, work his arms through the sleeves or let them hang freely under the coat. Jack’s legs...

Freddie told himself he would tackle this problem when the time came, but the problem did not follow his schedule. The scent of cinnamon was strong and Freddie returned to the kitchen, cutting the carrots and making the stew, the problem right beside him, demanding that he solve it.

<hr/>

Night fell and Freddie set up his cot beside the couch.

Jack’s body shuddered with each breath. He inhaled, stopped, and exhaled in a broken whistle. Freddie laid his hand on Jack’s, warm beneath the coarse skin. He brushed Jack’s fingers, recoiling at the first bulge. Freddie took a breath. Jack whistled one out, broken, and inhaled.

Freddie laid two fingers on the bulge.

It felt like a third knuckle, nothing more. Jack was disabled, not dead, but many people had died during the first rain. The rain didn’t kill you right away. You might stagger along for days, your face changing from bloody red to spoiled green, a slideshow of unnatural colors. Bulges sprouted under your jaw not unlike Jack’s, only these bulges were soft, they popped. Black fluid as viscous as oil drowned your tongue and stained your lips.

And those were the ones who’d died. Freddie stroked what remained of Jack’s hair. Not everyone perished from the rain and some lived with permanent color changes, others no color changes but they forgot things, their names, the date, and in a few extreme cases dove off buildings, convinced they were Superman. Others got sick and recovered, and they called it a foreign plot. The responsible party changed—Russia one week, China the next—and sometimes no one was responsible; one week it was a hoax. Nothing but a normal weather phenomenon, no need to worry, and when the raincoats were free these same people refused. They posted pictures on social media of themselves playing in the rain, banners around their profile pictures. <em>Live without fear</em> read one. <em>It’s just rain</em> read another, a bevy of online propaganda outlets readily exploiting people’s fears and soon after came the macabre. The posts of regret. Livestreams of their ICU trips, visits that turned into final stops. Calls for prayers, people online posting their stories, mocking them. <em>Sweet schadenfreude</em> they called it. That’s when Freddie and Jack got rid of their phones.

Freddie let go of Jack and laid on the cot. The seventh rain pouring without cease. He closed his eyes and with Jack’s breathing as his companion, he didn’t think of the online posts. He thought of Hodges Library in Knoxville, the stacks, a dim window of light. Jack by himself, Freddie asking if he could sit down. Packed to the rafters during finals, neglectful students cramming what would take a semester to learn. Jack offers him an Adderall and Freddie tells him <em>You’re an idiot for taking that shit, It’s Differential Equations, So? If you need help just ask</em> and Freddie slides into the chair beside Jack, helping him understand. <em>Are you ashamed?</em> The Supreme Court’s landmark ruling eight years away, Obama’s campaign in its infancy. <em>Are you ashamed?</em> Freddie won’t hold his hand on campus and Jack doesn’t understand how it is. Men don’t do this—your body tells you one thing, but society shouts, and if shouts don’t work, they’ll employ harsher methods. Don’t you understand?

<em>Are you ashamed?</em> and Freddie’s lips move, his words trapped in the atomic crawlspace between whisper and thought.

<em>I’m not ashamed.</em>

<hr/>

Freddie smelled cinnamon, patter of the seventh rain wrenching him awake. He let Jack rest and boiled a pot of oats on the woodstove and when Jack awoke Freddie helped him lean up, feeling the bulges and reminding himself <em>It’s just a knuckle, it’s just a knuckle.</em>

Freddie set up the TV tray, spoonfeeding Jack the oats. Jack’s mouth didn’t open all the way and he slurped his bites.

After the third bite, Jack chuckled.

“What?” Freddie said.

“This is all you know how to cook.”

“I’m the one who taught you, as I recall,” Freddie said, spooning him another bite. “Here.”

“I’m full.”

“You barely touched it.”

“I said I’m full.”

“Okay,” Freddie said, holding in his sigh till he got to the kitchen. He placed the bowl on the counter and wolfed down Jack’s leftovers. Engage in daily activities, focus on routine, and the sound didn’t leave him, neither that nor the smell. Freddie sniffed, wrinkling his nose. Patter of a rain that wettened nothing.

“I can smell it too,” Jack said when Freddie returned to the living room.

“Cinnamon.”

“I smelled it last rain,” Jack said.

Freddie nodded and squatted by the TV. They kept all the VHS’s and DVD’s in milk cartons. Freddie dug through the tapes, turning up <em>The Land Before Time.</em>

Freddie held up the tape.

Jack grunted. “At least it doesn’t have any songs.”

Freddie smiled. Another Knoxville conversation. Freddie pushed the tape into the VCR and turned on the TV. <em>The Lion King can’t hold a candle to The Land Before Time.</em> Freddie curled up on the couch beside Jack. <em>The Land Before Time accomplishes the same thing without any stupid songs.</em> This conversation in Jack’s dorm room. Freddie won’t bring Jack to his room. <em>Are you ashamed?</em>

A Pizza Hut commercial plays at the beginning of the tape.

<em>Are you</em>

The commercial ended with the boy’s mom kissing him on the cheek in front of his friends, and the boy wiping his cheek in embarrassment. Freddie gave Jack a plaintive look, and laid his hand on Jack’s, easing his thumb on the knuckle between knuckles.

“You remember the fire alarm?” Freddie asked while on the TV, bubbles rose in a prehistoric sea and a grandfatherly voice introduced the time of the dinosaurs. “Hess Hall, senior year.” By then Freddie and Jack lived on the same floor, the seventh, single rooms for upperclassmen. No less clandestine in their activities, Jack finally understanding how thing were and Freddie gave him another plaintive look. “Do you remember?”

Jack’s voice was slow and raspy, and Freddie immediately regretted pushing the question. “The fire alarm kept going off.”

“Yeah,” Freddie said. On the TV, Littlefoot’s mother and grandparents witnessed his birth, a lone egg hatching. “Never did find out who kept pulling it. Probably some dumbass freshman away from his parents for the first time.”

Jack spoke again, raspy: “It was Harold.”

“Who?”

“Harold.” Jack inhaled, as raggedy as his exhales. “On our floor.”

“Really?” Freddie searched his memory, turning up only faint impressions. “I can barely remember him.”

Another breath. “I saw him moving out.” Breath. “Asked why. Told me.”

“Fuck.” Cera informed Littlefoot that Three-Horns did not play with Longnecks, and Freddie said, “Hey you remember that guy in the towel, don’t you? Name was Herb. Remember?”

Jack’s face changed. What passed for a smile in his current state. Phantom of the cherubic face Freddie had first seen in the Hodges Library stacks. <em>Are you ashamed?</em>

“He was in the shower,” Freddie said. “And that douchebag pulled the alarm, and remember what Herb did? He come running outside in the freezing cold wearing only a bath towel.”

Freddie laughed, and Jack did too. Freddie superimposed the smile from Knoxville and a rain-free world over this one and leaned over and kissed his cheek.

Jack’s laughter sputtered like a bad exhaust pipe. He fell into a coughing fit, deep rockets from his chest that racked his body. Freddie’s first instinct was to slap his back and his hand was raised to do just that, and then he wrapped his arms gently around Jack.

“It’s okay.” Careful not to squeeze. Jack wheezed, Freddie reassuring him, “It’s okay, it’s okay.”

Jack’s wheezing tapered off, leaving Freddie with the sound of Littlefoot crying. Freddie looked at the screen. They’d missed the death of Littlefoot’s mother, <em>The real tragedy. Mufasa’s death isn’t as raw, it doesn’t impact you like Littlefoot’s mom</em>, dorm room conversations from a better world.

“Jack?” Freddie slid his finger under Jack’s nose. “Jack?” Freddie didn’t count the seconds, and when the familiar warmth tickled Freddie’s finger, he waited. Another warmth, another wait, another warmth, Littlefoot chasing his enlarged shadow, believing it’s his mom and Freddie thought Jack was right. This had more impact that Mufasa ever could. Another breath, then: “Are you okay?”

Jack blinked and Freddie continued holding him, wrinkling his nose, doing his best to ignore the rain and the cinnamon until Littlefoot and his friends made it to the Great Valley.

<hr/>

Freddie stirred during the credits and went to the window. He fingered the curtain and listened to Jack. Ragged wheeze after ragged wheeze. Freddie let go of the curtain and went over to him.

Jack. In Knoxville, they went to the Old City to see Einstein Simplified, an improv troupe. A woman held the front door open and Freddie ran ahead to catch it, and when he looked back, Jack was shuffling along, still in the parking lot.

<em>Why’re you walking like one leg’s shorter than the other?</em> Freddie positioned his hands on Jack, careful not to press too hard. He wouldn’t get an answer until the ER visit, 400 bucks neither Jack nor his parents could afford.

Freddie set Jack upright. Bags beneath his eyes, purple splotches like misapplied eyeliner. No longer did he have to raise his eyebrows to show his forehead wrinkles and Freddie ran a finger over the fleshy ridges like he used to, and like he used to, Freddie raised his own eyebrows. Now he had forehead wrinkles, and no one mistook them for high schoolers anymore.

“You got a widow’s peak from Hell,” Freddie whispered. He placed his finger under Jack’s nose. The warmth was too weak to tickle his finger. Freddie listened to him rasp, waiting for it to get better but like Jack told him the night after the ER, <em>There’s no getting better from this.</em>

Back at the window, Freddie peeked out the curtain. Fall of the seventh rain. A steady percussion on the roof of their trailer. The scent of cinnamon and there, beyond the valley.

A pink hue gathering over the mountains.

Freddie flung the curtain shut and closed his eyes. He rubbed them with his thumbs, determined to force himself to see properly. With the scent of cinnamon gaining strength, it was bound to happen, but now wasn’t the time. They hadn’t the first clue of how bad it could get, the doubters and the panickers alike. Soon they would know, and no amount of online propaganda could change that.

Freddie stood over Jack, crumpled remnants of a man. Go, flee...but how? Freddie sold the truck years ago, and there were no trains within a hundred miles, leaving...

Freddie glanced at the raincoats and when he looked back, Jack’s eyes were open.

“Hey,” Freddie said.

“Hey.”

“How are you feeling?”

A wheeze answered him.

“I think we have some Mucinex.” Freddie sat on the cushion beside Jack, careful not to drop down too hard. “Clear it right up.”

Another wheeze, more like a chuckle. Jack’s lips peeling back in the dark, hint of the smile from Hodges Library. <em>Are you ashamed?</em>

Freddie stroked his hair. “I’ll go get it.”

“Juice.”

Freddie shook his head. “I don’t, I...”

“Please.” Jack wheezed, trying to say more. “I—” Several deep coughs tore through his mouth, Jack raising his working yet mangled hand to stifle them and he coughed all the harder. He tilted towards the floor and Freddie caught him, setting him upright, his twisted body convulsing. Mucus seeped through his teeth, most of it gurgling in his throat. Jack gave one last harsh cough, spraying the carpet with yellow mucus, and lay still.

“Jack,” Freddie whispered. Stroking the wisps of his hair. The movie had stopped some time ago and the VCR was set to automatically rewind. The tape rewound, spinning, spinning on its wheels, and stopping with a click.

Freddie spoke: “I dumped out the juice.”

Neither of them held any illusions about Jack’s condition. Such was the allowance of childhood, but what their nature told them equaled what society hated, and their understanding forced them into several agreements. Even before the first rain, Jack had told him, with a mouth that still opened all the way and a body with a few extra growths rather than dozens, <em>I’m not dying in a hospital. I’m doing this on my own terms.</em> By then Jack understood how it was, though the suspicion never left his eyes, the question those eyes asked, and Freddie saw the question now and turned his face away from it.

“I’m—” not ashamed “—sorry, Jack.” Freddie held him, gently, whispering the only words he could think to say. “I’m sorry, Jack. I’m sorry.”

<hr/>

The trailer door opened on a dry cobalt tomb.

A wonder in those infant days. No drowning, only black blotches, fluid. Death.

Freddie stepped outside in his raincoat, kicking the door shut behind him. He wore his satchel slung over his shoulder, meager provisions stuffed inside, and in his arms he carried Jack like an offering to the gods. Jack was wrapped in a raincoat, Freddie maneuvering his limbs inside as best as the growths would allow. They fused his joints together. One leg wasn’t shorter than the other, and Freddie stopped several times to listen to Jack wheeze, gargle, threatening coughs, periods of silence stretching out between each one.

“We’ll be okay,” Freddie said, and set off down the road. The scent of cinnamon was strong enough to knock you over. More of a stench to Freddie, and he stopped, gazing out at the landscape like a frontier explorer.

The seventh rain fell from a sky as blue as the vaults of limbo. <em>Christ</em>, Freddie thought, <em>no wonder people went mad.</em>

Freddie resumed his journey. The unflooded town had a clinic. No hospital, but there were doctors. They would have pills, cough syrup, antibiotics, and Freddie whispered, “You’re going to be okay.”

Jack in his arms. He weighed more than Freddie had thought, and Freddie stopped again, his arms aching. He looked down into Jack’s face, safe beneath the screen. Jack gazed up at the blue origins of the seventh rain with all the curiosity of a doll. Breathes wheezed and stumbled through his teeth; he no longer breathed through his nose.

“Jack,” Freddie said. He held Jack closer to his stomach, taking some weight off his arms. Sweat rolled from Freddie’s forehead and into his eyes, and he blinked, his eyes stinging, the sweat bead curling and warping his vision and above the stinging he repeated Jack’s name.

He followed the road. The dry asphalt curved around a pair of signs warning drivers of a steep decline and on the descent weight gathered in Freddie’s arms once more. His eyes burning, the seventh rain pattering his raincoat. Sweat pouring down his pantlegs and staining his socks.

Freddie forced himself to keep going, tottering downhill with the gait of a penguin. Near the bottom of the hill a Honda Civic was parked on the side of the road. The doors closed, no one inside. A more common occurrence starting in the second rain. Family goes out for a drive, wanders off into the rain, bedlam fates preferable to the stench of cinnamon. No eighth rain, no ninth, and Freddie passed beneath an arch framed in painted roses welcoming them to Hendersonville.

Freddie fell to one knee. His arms were screaming. “Jack,” he said. No breathing above the patter of the rain. Freddie leaned over. “Jack. I’m sorry.”

Freddie laid Jack on the asphalt and opened the satchel. He removed a jar, wrapped in towels secured in a sheet bend knot. Jack knew how to tie them. His father had shown him and Freddie never asked if Jack still talked to his dad; as the years progressed society appeared to change its mind but Freddie never trusted it. <em>You don’t know how things are</em> how stupid was he to assume that? “I’m sorry,” Freddie said. “I never dumped out the juice.” Freddie choked on his next words and out of habit tried to wipe his face, gloved hands stroking his face-screen.

A smile in the library stacks. Discussions about the death of Littlefoot’s mom versus Mufasa’s demise. Freddie unbuttoned his raincoat, the words building up but finding no home, neither in his head or in his mouth and as he slipped out of his raincoat, he held Jack close and set them free, <em>I’m not ashamed</em>, and the seventh rain poured on Freddie, it poured on Jack, it poured on the town, it poured on everything and it poured dry.

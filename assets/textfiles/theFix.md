Ryan hid his sweating hands in the pocket of his jacket. Felt the smooth surface of the object within, the reassurance of its presence. If he could just—

“—But the slush readers,” Vita was saying, her hands spreading outwards. She leaned an elbow on the bar, pearls draped over clinging black satin, amber light defining her cheekbones.

As she gushed on, his mind drifted between options. A fresh-pressed Ramspeck sounded more exciting, but a good vintage Stohlman could do just the trick.

“Ryan, pay attention!”

“Right, yes. What's wrong with the slush readers?”

She signed like a balloon deflating. “They've been approving submissions filled with typos and misplaced commas.”

“But were they <em>good</em>?”

“The commas, Ryan! I had to reject them. I have appearances to keep up.”

“Yeah...” he said, though he didn't agree with her, though his heart was beating faster, though he felt a sensation like itching beneath his skin.

Vita’s fathomless eyes seemed to pin him to the floor. “They don’t call me the Word Destroyer for nothing.”

Ryan shivered. He knew better than to subject his own work to Vita’s relentless precision. Yet his objection overcame his usual wariness. “Yeah, but some of that slush...”

“In flagrant disrespect of the guidelines!” Vita ranted on, rouged lips shaping words as if underlining them with red pen. Ryan wanted to say more, to defend the robust plots and engaging characters he’d found in her submissions pile, but he knew she would take it as a weakness. And the craving—it was causing him to cut short his sentences, to speed up the conversation.

If his symptoms were discernible, they were invisible to Vita. She went on, concocting punishments with increasing absurdity.

Ryan wiped sweat from his brow. “Hanging them by their ankles while you read them Crime and Punishment won't fix their grammar. I, uh…”

Her pencilled brows arched.

Ryan knew he should stand up for the hapless writers whose work had landed on Vita’s desk, but a white light blaze filled his mind with a single thought.

“I’ll be back. I really need to—”

Vita shot him a glare.

“Excuse me.”

He edged through the crowd to the back of the bar, where a shadowy space was cast in blue light. There were two doors. Above one was the outline of a cigarette, above the other in yellow, a lightning bolt.

He stepped into the door with the lightning bolt.

The room was lit with yellow incandescent lights, brighter than the bar but suitably ambient. The chairs were angled away from each other, separated by bookshelves and a fish tank where Fire Mouth Chichlids drifted in a slow endless dance.

Ryan sank into the nearest chair, his breathing rapid. The metal surface was covered with a cushion, just enough to lessen the hardness, not thick enough to sink into. The room allowed its occupants a reprieve, but not to linger.

Ryan's fingers tingled as he withdrew the slim device from his pocket. As opened the flap, his pulse-rate slowed, and he let out a sigh as the words quenched his craving. The backlit screen adjusted to the lighting of the room, the opening line grabbed his attention, and he was in—to a new piece of flash fiction, a tiny bite-sized unfurling world. Instant immersion to another life, cares, and struggles. Observations that sliced through the fat of existence to its muscled, throbbing heart. He'd been mining Vita's cast-offs to feed his addiction, but he'd never let her know. Small devastating fictions that tore him apart and put him back together again, wiser and more capable. Till he emerged from the Flash Room renewed.

He looked at the row of e-readers, set on clear plastic stands that he could pull free by sliding a coin into the slot. Those were for the shallow-waders, the ones who neglected to bring their own devices, the ones who hadn't yet built up a diehard flash addiction. Their time would come when the craving struck like a bolt from a wide blue sky.

Ryan had his preferences, the authors he could trust to reel him in and punch him where it hurt. The rest of life was easier to cope with, afterwards.

As he returned to his body, he became aware of the others in the room. A balding man in a wrinkled dress-shirt, reading with avid eyes. A woman with her high heels sprawled in front of her, bent head screened by a curtain of hair. Lawyers and schoolgirls, athletes and grandmothers. He heard indrawn breaths, stifled laughter, satisfied sighs.

Five minutes later he was back on his feet, ready to face the lava flow of Vita's invective with renewed empathy. As he emerged from the room, a sweating youth with trembling hands walked towards him, and he held the door open.

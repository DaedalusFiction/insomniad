In the morning when she opened the door, it was waiting for her out in the hall. It was covered in long white fur with soft grey patches, and the way it was sitting made it appear to be almost completely round. Two amber eyes peered out above a tiny pink nose that looked as clean and soft as a freshly fallen flower petal. Agnes held the door open and stared at it. <em>This reminds me,</em> she thought, I used to have one just like it. <em>How could someone just...I certainly shouldn’t...</em>but by then the door had been held open long enough. Invitation accepted, it seemed to think as it sauntered its way into Agnes’ apartment.

<em>I won’t keep it,</em> she told herself. She got out the cereal and poured—one bowl for her, and then another, in case it was hungry.

That afternoon, while she was reading at the window, it came over to where she was sitting and coiled itself tightly around her leg. She didn’t know if she should touch it, but after a few minutes went by she found she just couldn’t resist. The fur was warm and thick. Little beads of drool formed from its thin pink lips, and it surprised her slightly by making a soft hush sound over and over–something between a pant and a hiss. Agnes put down her book and buried both of her hands into its dense softness.

That night, although she knew she shouldn’t, she left the door to her bedroom open just a crack. She could hear it skittering around in the apartment, knocking against the dishes in the sink, old wooden floors creaking softly beneath stealthy little feet. Agnes lay awake for a long time, waiting for its strange, impish face to appear at the crack. Hours passed but it did not come. <em>It’s for the best,</em> Agnes thought, before she finally fell asleep.

When she woke up the next morning, she realized that she had been scratching at her arms in the night. They were red and a bit puffy, crisscrossed with raised white lines where she’d drawn her fingernails hard across the skin. And they were very, very itchy. Agnes turned on the shower and stood beneath the cool water, which seemed to help at first. But when she got out the itch returned, along with an ominous tingling in her feet and hands, which she knew was a precursor to more itching.

She looked around the living room for her little friend but couldn’t find it anywhere. She knew it must be asleep under a piece of furniture somewhere. She poured two bowls of cereal and waited for it to join her.

By the next day the itch had grown so intense that she was forced to call the doctor, who listened to her describe the problem and then recommended that she come in immediately. The doctor examined her swollen skin, ripped raw in places, already beginning to crust and scab over. “You are having a reaction,” he explained to her. “Have you been exposed to anything new recently?”

“No,” she sighed, “Not new. I think it may be the fur.”

“Oh,” said the doctor. Agnes looked down at her hands, folded tightly together in her lap. Her palms were on fire. “You really shouldn’t be in close proximity to any fur.”

“I know,” she said.

“You were doing so well,” said the doctor.

“I know,” she said.

The doctor sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, hard. “If you insist on doing this,” he said, unable to keep a hint of disappointment from his voice, “there is a medication that could help. But be sure to only take one pill per day. They can be incredibly addicting. And, really,”--here he sounded wholly disappointed, indeed--“you should seriously consider just getting rid of it.”

But by the time she got home and unlocked her door, keys jingling in her hand, pills jangling in her purse, she had made up her mind. Somebody else had already put it out into the cold. A previous owner had clearly cherished it, kept it safe, cared for it, and then one day just ruthlessly abandoned it. <em>She</em> wasn’t going to give up so easily. She was in control. She wouldn’t let things get out of hand.

This wouldn’t be anything like the last time.

She downed a pill with a glass of water and went to sit by the window. Within minutes it was there with her, curled up in her lap, snoring softly. Between bouts of scratching, she combed its fur gently with her fingers, fondled its long-felted ears, ran her hands down the length of its body from its nose to the tip of its tail, where a cluster of scales she had not previously noticed glowed iridescent in the soft daylight. She buried her face into the warm place between its shoulder blades and inhaled deeply.

The pills worked fine at first. She was still vaguely itchy all the time, and incredibly, unbearably itchy some of the time, but it didn’t really seem so bad. She had taken to propping her bedroom door open every night. She had even started calling it before she went to bed, making little kissy noises to try to lure it in, but although it seemed quite fond of her during the day at night it lingered in the hallway, hesitant. She lay in bed and scratched, wondering why it wouldn’t come in.

It wasn’t long before she was taking two pills a day, then up to three. Sometimes three pills was what it took to keep from feeling the itch pricking like hot needles across her scalp, radiating the whole way down the length of her spine. She showered two or three times a day, did her best to keep up with the vacuuming, wiped down all the surfaces religiously. Three layers of clothing took the sting off when she couldn’t stop her hands from scratching. She was vaguely aware that the pills didn’t actually stop the itch; they just numbed her skin to the feeling of it. Her brain still understood that there was something that urgently needed to be clawed at, scraped off, torn into. If she didn’t stay vigilant, her body did these things to itself without her consent.

One day three pills was not enough, and so she took four. On that day, the summer sun was setting as she sat down at the window to read. At first when she lifted her hand to turn the page she thought what she was seeing was the reddish glow of the sunset filtering through sinew and bone. When the page bloomed with color she stared at it dumbly before slowly moving her eyes to her fingertips. They were dripping. She lifted her hand to her cheek to find that she had clawed a hole in it.

<em>I’ll take another shower,</em> she thought, and as she stumbled to the bathroom it followed her from their place by the window down the hallway to the bath. She turned the water on and carefully peeled off the layers of clothing, stiff and sticky in some places and wet in others. She couldn’t feel the water on her skin. She couldn’t feel it coming through the hole where her cheek should be.

When she was done with her shower, she looked for a clean towel, but there were none. She thought about nightgowns and t-shirts and sweatpants, layers and layers to protect her from herself during the night, but as she padded dripping down the hall, a warm breeze whispered in through her open bedroom window, and she thought, no. It trailed after her, careful to avoid stepping in any tiny, crimson-tinted puddles.

Lying naked in her bed, she smiled because she couldn’t feel her skin against her fingertips, or underneath her fingernails. When it wasn’t enough, she used the metal nail file from her bedside drawer. Then she used her teeth. She couldn’t feel a thing except the wetness of the blood, the sticking of the sheets as they grew saturated with the stuff of her. Her brain screamed at her to <em>keep going,</em> to <em>dig deeper. Almost there.</em>

At last, with a large ripping motion of the file, she felt it. Relief. The itch was gone. Her hands gathered up the hot, offensive organs that came spilling out from beneath her ribcage. She pushed them aside to make a hollow place, leaned back against the pillows and closed her eyes.

It watched all of this from the doorway, waiting. When it was time, it crossed the threshold into the room, jumped up onto the bed where she was reclining, and nestled its body into the warm, soft hole just beneath Agnes’ ribcage. Once inside, its soft white fur bloomed crimson, round amber eyes narrowed and shifted red to match.

It fit perfectly.

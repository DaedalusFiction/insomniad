The Seer lived somewhere in the hills above the town. Everyone knew that but not everyone called her The Seer. The hills were a constantly looming abyss, a long semi-circular growth of dark green morass, that hung in the back of everyone’s minds as they went about their daily business with the same forcefulness of constant aching awareness that once would have come with the knowledge that the inescapable suspended silhouette against the setting sun on the highest peak was the crumbling corpse of a condemned criminal. The gibbet might have passed with the slowly streaming centuries, but the people of the town still drank hard and conducted their lives with a grim, haunted solemnity, penned-in and overpowered as they were. They hated The Seer because she was a reminder upon a reminder; a poisonous cherry atop a moldering Bakewell; the hermit who confirmed the hermitage of their lives. So, they called her curse words.

Terence was one who called her The Seer. Terence went up into the hills to find her on a Tuesday. He had her banjo. She’d told him on one of the rare days she had descended into Chasteborough, walking beneath a black cloud of falling rain that hovered six feet above her head alone, that she’d left it in a semi-detached on Runner Street in 1956, when the house was new and the inhabitant needed a song from her. She’d sung then of what had happened in Korea and what was happening in Suez; her audience’s son was stationed in Egypt for his National Service. The language of the song had been coded, not direct, but the message of comfort had been received. After, she’d forgotten her banjo and the woman had kept it because she thought it had been a further offering for good luck. Now the woman was gone, the son was gone and the house was due to be emptied and resold and she needed it back. Terence had forced open a sash window and jimmied his way inside, almost falling into the kitchen sink as he’d wormed through. He had the banjo now though.

The choice of instrument made sense once he was in the hills. Before, he’d been surprised; oracles were usually supposed to have harps or something equally and pleasingly classical. But The Seer’s landscape was not that of academic painters: it was English in its flora, fauna and birdlife, but also like the hollers of Kentucky or Virginia, all shadowed groves and dark openings in sinister green. The trees were bunched and gnarled like fairytale symbols; the faces of Chasteborough dead shouted wordlessly from the split bark. It was a place of blood and toil, no doubt, but kept as clean as a grave, brooding like a regretful elderly man. Yes, the banjo was perfect; humble and half-American, lyrical but with the momentum of a swift uppercut, eccentric, homely and alien.

Terence walked two miles across the outer crest of the hills and found The Seer in a buttercup-dotted field. She was blowing on a dandelion, but the orb did not disperse in the wind, as if no breath touched it. As usual, her skin was dark, although Terence could not tell if this was natural or the result of decades spent living in the mud of the hills, and her hair was bright golden ringlets, as freshly washed-looking and long as a young girl’s on their first day of school.

Terence slung the banjo case off his back. She snatched at it greedily.

“Thank you, T-Bone," she said, placing the case on the ground before her. “How is Chasteborough?”

“Same old.”

“Same old,” she repeated. “Aye. That's right. By name as by nature. No romance in Chasteborough.”

Terence smiled.

“Figure on a tune?” she asked.

“You don't have to. Might not be my time yet.”

“Sky is grey, not blue. The air hangs with drizzle. Grass is cold and mud is damp. That’s the time for a Chasteborough boy alright."

The banjo made even more sense when she started playing. She didn’t hammer the strings, like most did, but picked at them like a robin at a hunk of bread. It sounded like crying. Sharp tears and tight wails, not lugubrious sobbing.

Rain clouds like that one of The Seer's descended upon Chasteborough in the crater below the hill’s lip. It started hail storming, small chunks of ice relentlessly kissing the roofs of the houses, and The Seer sang of the bodies on the gibbet, giving them all names, and smiling upon their spirits as they darted across the sudden darkness of the afternoon. She knew them well, evidently, and the song shared little jokes and asides with them amongst the tragic litanies.

<em>“Hanging time’s back again,</em>

<em>The hangman’s walking too. </em>

<em>There’s hatin’ hearts in Chasteborough,</em>

<em>And they’ve got legs to come for you.”</em>

These were the first lines that struck Terence as meant for him also. He dropped his head and cast his eyes up at her. The meaning was burning in his chest.

“Am I right in my thinking?”

She nodded; her pale eyes doleful.

“No. No, it can’t be. It’s not that way anymore. Those days are gone.”

“Poor boy. You’ve got your eyes looking the wrong way. It’s building. Can’t you see it? Hatin’ hearts in Chasteborough and hatin’ hearts beyond. Hatin’ hearts all over. There’s a long way to fall again before it gets put back to rights.”

He shook his head. He didn’t want to believe it. <em>Tell me that it isn’t true.</em>

“Take the banjo. Maybe she was right. Maybe it is good luck.”

Terence nodded and then ran. He ran the two miles back, through the field, through the holler-hills, through the town. He swore and screamed the whole time. The Seer watched him from afar for days until he vowed to put a sword through the hatin’ heart. It was the right decision and she smiled.

### Simply put, 

the mind is a fine place for crucifixion 
the wax plate fair for a rood, rainwater 
chamomile and polyester armor for my 
long crusade in the rain, two miles until 
my imminent Outremer comes spitting 
through the streak. Some might say  
that walking all this way, a company to 
downpour, all for want of umbrella is, 
simply put: another game the martyr 
should not play

from home I have wandered, but for whom 
have I squandered these partial astrides, 
these carols of sibilant dawn, these rituals 
of self becoming something else? Something 
so willingly estranged, a wasp without its 
hive, an eye in a mouth, so solemnly incensed 
by color, sight, anything that tears and builds, 
tears and gilds itself in edible foils, folly 
freezing on unbreathing skin

### Pectoralis Major

I was asked, mid-rolling of my arms,
what hurt and I, knowing I should
always be specific in what hurts me,
answered: _why, my pectoralis major_

And when the panhandler called me
a whippy motherfucker I asked him
his name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert, he said, staring 
suddenly at himself, because I 
should also know the names of
what tries to hurt me, even if it
doesn’t sting to its fullest fancy,
even if, I’m sorry to say, I can’t
feel it through some other muscle

I don’t think it has much to do with
lactic acid anymore, but could I
use each injury in a sentence?
Could they be spelled, dispelled, 
protracted in the learning of their names?

The other day I almost choked
to death on an unknown morsel,
yellow in its serving.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I survived,
but hunched forward, found no name
for the obstruction, thought so
literally little of it, but still cried myself
out of paying the bill

### Birthday Suit

There’s something rearranged in me,
the heart of this, my artery
distracts the head, and if I sneeze,
squeeze out the parts I hardly need.
&nbsp;

Since when was I a blood collage,
appeasement in this flesh garage,
enmeshed in what is best for love,
or, lacking that, the lack thereof?
&nbsp;

No good the gut too flushed to churn,
or eyes comprised of veiny burn,
no good the hands, no good the feet,
no good this abacus of meat.
&nbsp;

And I the calculating grasp
deflated voice with faulty rasp
that bears no sound and yet is heard
in punctured passings of a word.
&nbsp;

And what a load of yikes to think
of anything with all this pink,
gelatinized, and I still wish
the rest is bronze and knows no squish.

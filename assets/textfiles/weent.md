#### THE DEATH OF BUCK SLUB COFFEY

If Weeky Weenstock wese a true blue pious ‘n forthright gilt-edged Great Wary old-sweat ten he might a sloughed a tin canny hat ‘n chucked hemself up out of tee trenchy water ‘n onto belly of muddy helly ‘n crossed Nomans land slither-like ta rescue poor Buck Slub Coffey from where short stick shrapnel slapped sickly o’er half he’s entire thigh-knee assuring Coffey a prosthesis and Weenstock most surely of a noble tink-pin on his vesty felt.

But he ween’t no hero.

#### THE ELIMINATION OF RUDDY RUCKSUMP

If Ruddy Rucksump hed been a touchy on tee smart side when he sprung over top <em>of Der Schhtzengraben</em> engaging in matters ablutionary in zinging bullet zig zag riddled air ‘n dropping trou ‘n sitting squaty-like to flare bright flanks ‘n ta a hundred thousand terrified (and amazed) eyes peering from dirty cheeks he might heve considered <em>a priori</em>-like tee lead hunky with engraved R. Rucksump sent to emboss hes chest, C.O.D.R.I.P.

Now hes hopped it. Er ist aus.

#### THE OBSEQUIES OF TIM TRIPP

If Tim Tripp, sixteen Christmases ta his name, had tasted one stale biscuit with axle grease ‘n turnip jam on a wednesdayfoggy morn heed tasted his last. Four days tee trench men weary wearily cantillated:

<em>If you get stuck on the wire, never mind</em>
<em>And your face may lose its smile, never mind</em>

Trippy Tim, tribulations relinquished, taunting, <em>risorgimento</em> with toothy grin demonstrating a grim truth (no blighty wound theer).

He ween’t no more eether.

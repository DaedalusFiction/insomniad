                                and clap way too loud for buskers.

                                Chandler McGraw is an artist, photographer,
                                critic, and museum professional based out of
                                Roanoke, VA. He graduated from George Mason
                                University in 2020, having studied studio art
                                and sculpture. As a sculptor and mixed-media
                                artist he is experienced with copper and steel,
                                among other mediums. His experimental style
                                draws influence from the works of Lee Bontecou,
                                Louise Nevelson, and John Baldasari. Outside his
                                artistic efforts, Chandler is still seeking the
                                Alf calendar with Melmackian anniversary gifts.
                                He loves when tiny things are contained inside a
                                larger version of themselves and frequently
                                enjoys Twizzlers.

                            The Rumen is committed to publishing high-quality
                            poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, and art by all
                            peoples, especially individuals from historically
                            underrepresented demographics. We believe that art
                            is a vehicle for inter- and intrapersonal
                            connection, and we are especially interested in work
                            that effectively describes what it means to be
                            human, in an intellectual, emotional, bodily, and/or
                            communal way.

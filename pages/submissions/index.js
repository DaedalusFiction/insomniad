                                The rumen is our favorite portion of the
                                cow&rsquo;s stomach. It is here that gut
                                microbes facilitate fermentation of ingested
                                foodstuffs. It is here that all those difficult
                                cereals and grasses, those hard-to-process
                                things, start to break down. We like to think of
                                literature as a sort of rumen, that narrow
                                tunnel where things accrue, sit, on their way to
                                something elemental.

                                We at The Rumen publish works that move in the
                                conceptual, that draw the tangential lines
                                between condition and potential. We seek work
                                that blends neoclassical ideas with urban
                                grunge, the high concepts of reality mixed with
                                the low reductions of fantasy. Like the
                                aforementioned digesta, we want things that find
                                new meaning when thrust through the reticulum of
                                the written word. We want humor, horror, strange
                                fixations, canvases upended, bodies broken down
                                cell by cell. We know, we know, there are plenty
                                of submission guidelines with similarly vague
                                poetasting out there. The fact is we don&rsquo;t
                                always know what we want until we see it, until
                                we sit with it a while&mdash;ruminate on it, if
                                you will.

                                For poetry we are interested in works that
                                emphasize craft. We want poems with interesting
                                forms, strong sonics, and striking images
                                flawlessly rendered. Traditional forms are
                                welcome but we lean more toward works that take
                                risks and challenge notions of traditional
                                poetics. We especially appreciate conceptual
                                poems that do a few things really well rather
                                than many things with mediocrity.

                                word limits, with extra believable or
                                unbelievable characters, and balanced prose that
                                demonstrates equal mastery of action and
                                imagery. Our favorite stories leave us with as
                                many questions as answers, so don&rsquo;t be
                                afraid to weave in your best literary ambiguity.
                                That being said, the purely aesthetic can be a
                                hard sell, so consider closely before sending us

                                combines these fields. Thoughtful analyses of

                                welcome. Memoir or personal essays can teach us
                                a lot about ourselves, and we ask that
                                submissions in these genres have a strong
                                central theme or moral. Works of a semi-academic
                                or political nature will require citations,
                                preferably in MLA format.
